# Quick Start
After compiling the code and having the executable in ```src_clean/``` folder, run the command below:
```
python run_designated_folders.py
```
Wait and see the result!
# Pytest
:memo: If you have pytest installed, after running the previous command, do:
```
pytest -s
```
You can see the energy drift and time elapsed for the test simulations you just run!
